- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SteliosCantCode, my real name is Stelios. I am a teen and I am a student, so I don't have much time for coding and the like, but I am trying.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming as a hobby because it's fun and I have nothing better to do. Also, it helps with jobs, doesn't it? I also like the idea of software engineering and game dev, 
  though I don't know if I will be able to land a coding job
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python!
